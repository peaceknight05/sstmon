# Contributing
Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing:

## Indentation
Every time a new section of code is typed, leave a new line.

## Commenting
Try to explain briefly what the block of code is for.

## Names
Generally,
* Use camel case.
* Make the names short and relavant.

### Variables
Variable names should be related to what it is for.
Should the variable be a boolean, add an "is" before the variable.
Adding "no" in a integer/float variable name is preffered but not required.

### Classes
Every word in a class name should be capitalized.

### Methods
Method names should be in camel case, and calling a method should have parenthesis behind, even if there are no arguments.
